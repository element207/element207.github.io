The library is based on research done by [CMLA ENS-Cachan](http://www.cmla.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/) and [IMAGINE LIGM ENPC](http://imagine.enpc.fr/), and the reference paper titled [Lens Distortion Correction with a Calibration Harp](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221121089_Lens_distortion_correction_with_a_calibration_harp). The code was adapted from originally written Matlab prototype by [Zhongwei Tang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhongwei_Tang/publications).
