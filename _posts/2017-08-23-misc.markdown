# Welcome to Jekyll!

I always build pages locally before uploading to GitHub, I can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run  
 {% highlight Shell%}
 $ jekyll serve 
 {% endhighlight %}
 under my web project folder, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates my site when a file is updated.

> But you can only access the web on the server machine itself, because it is using **http://127.0.0.1:4000** to host the pages.

# Specify Jekyll Serve IP
If you want to access the web pages on the other client, there is a way to start web server:
  
{% highlight Shell %}
# assuming server ip address is 192.168.0.100 
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --host 192.168.0.100
{% endhighlight %}

> Now, You can access the web pages by access **http://192.168.0.100:4000** from anywhere you want within the intranet.
